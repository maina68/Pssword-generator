# Pssword-generator
A simple password generator code in python
Before starting to  generate passwords,password requirements such as complexity, length, and allowed characters need to be defined.
Based on the password requirements specified above, character sets that will be used to generate the passwords are defined.
'string.ascii_lowercase' is a predefined python library that defines character sets.
Once password requirements and character sets are defined, you can generate a random password using a random number generator to select characters from the character set you defined.This process can be repeated till your password meets the requirements.
Once you have generated the password, you can output it to the user.
